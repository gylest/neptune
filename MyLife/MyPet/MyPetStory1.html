                                The name "Shih Tzu" (pronounced <em>sheed-zoo</em>) comes from the Mandarin Chinese word for "lion."
                                The breed was given this name due to its resemblance to the lions depicted in
                                traditional Chinese art and its association with Buddhist legends where a small
                                lion-like dog traveled with the Buddha.

                                Shih Tzus were cherished companions to Chinese emperors for centuries.
                                They lived luxurious lives inside the imperial palace and were so prized that for many
                                years, it was forbidden for anyone outside the royalty to own one.

                                The Breed Nearly Went Extinct
                            </h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-11">
                                Following the end of imperial rule in China, the breed's numbers dwindled dramatically.
                                The Shih Tzu as we know it today was saved thanks to a very small breeding stock—every
                                modern Shih Tzu can trace its lineage back to just 14 dogs (seven males and seven
                                females) that were used to rebuild the breed.

                                This charming nickname comes from the way the hair on their muzzle grows.
                                It sprouts upwards and outwards in all directions, resembling the petals of a
                                chrysanthemum flower.

                                They Have a Double Coat, But Shed Minimally

                                Despite their long, luxurious-looking fur, Shih Tzus are surprisingly low-shedding.
                                They have a double coat, but the shed hair tends to get caught in the outer coat rather
                                than falling onto furniture.
                                This is why they require daily brushing to prevent mats and tangles.

                                Their ancestors are believed to have originated in the monasteries of Tibet, where they
                                were likely given as gifts to Chinese royalty.

                                A distinct feature of the Shih Tzu is its undershot bite, or underbite.
                                This is where the lower jaw is slightly longer than the upper jaw, causing the bottom
                                teeth to protrude in front of the top teeth when the mouth is closed.
                                This is a required trait in the breed standard.
